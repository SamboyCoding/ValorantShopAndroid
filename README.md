# ValorantShopAndroid

Quick-and-dirty Android app built with Xamarin.Android and @RumbleMike's ValNet to allow viewing of your Valorant daily shop from your phone.

This project uses a modified version of ValNet adapted for netstandard2.0, but for licensing reasons this cannot be uploaded here, so the project likely will not build.

This will be remedied soon, once ValNet gets updated with the necessary changes.

The UI is almost deliberately bad - the app is supposed to be very at-a-glance and nothing more.
